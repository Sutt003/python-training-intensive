The best way to learn is by doing. That's why, over the these three days, **you are tasked with analysing, visualising and reporting on a set of data!**

Roughly 50% of our intensive is dedicated to working on the project. Working in groups of 2-4, you'll need to use the techniques we learn to draw some observations about your chosen dataset. 

The end goal will be a quick fire (low stakes) one-minute presentation with a dashboard to complement.

[See below](#submission) for submission details.

## The datasets

We have eight datasets for you to choose from:

| Dataset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [World populations](../data_sources/population.csv) | A summary of world populations and corresponding statistics | 
| [Soccer players](../data_sources/Players2024.csv) | A summary of about 250 2024 soccer players |
| [Coffee survey](../data_sources/coffee_survey.csv) | A survey of coffee preferences | 
| [Melbourne housing data](data_sources/melb_data.csv) | A collection of houses for sale in Melbourne | 
| [Goodreads books](data_sources/books.csv) | Data for 50,000 goodreads books |
| [Queensland hospitals](data_sources/hospital_data.csv) | Emergency department statistics |
| [Queensland fuel prices](data_sources/qld_fuel.csv) | Fuel prices by the pump in Queensland | 
| [Aeroplane bird strikes](data_sources/birds_strikes.csv) | Aeroplane bird strike incidents fron the 90s| 

## Project outline

There are a few key requirements for the project, but otherwise it's up to you!

- Analyse a dataset and create some visualisations 
- Put together a final dashboard-style report. Anything from a powerpoint slide to an interactive dashboard will do!
- Deliver a quick fire one-minute presentation with your group

We'll have 5 sessions during the intensive days to work on the project, just shy of six hours. The goal of these sessions is twofold

1. To work on the project, analysing data and creating visualisations
2. To dive deeper into the content, perfect for questions and conversations

While you'll be working in groups, everyone should practise analysing and visualising the data. We recommend distributing roles amongst the group, maybe looking at different variables or different presentation formats.

You're welcome to use the project time however you'd like. Below is a rough guide if you're unsure:

| Session | Recommendation | 
| --- | --- |
| Tuesday afternoon | Pick a dataset and play with the data |
| Wednesday morning | More exploratory analysis, consider dividing roles amongst group |
| Wednesday afternoon | Start collecting initial visualisations and preparing format (e.g. dashboard) |
| Thursday morning | Continue analysing and creating visualisations |
| Thursday afternoon | Polish up results |

The presentations will be during Thursday's final session at 2:50pm.

Good luck!

## Submission

There are two ways you can upload your visualisations.

### Upload dashboard to GitHub

This is the advanced way of doing things - we recommend this way, because it'll show you a good insight into using GitHub.

1. [Create a GitHub account and log in](https://github.com/)
2. Create a fork of our [python-training-intensive] repository. This is a copy of the repo in your account, changes *will not automatically affect the main repo*. **Leave all settings unchanged**.
3. Go into the `Projects` folder, and click `Add file` $\rightarrow$ `Create new file`.
4. Give it a name but **no content**. This will be your folder. Press `Commit changes...`.
5. Go into your new folder and click `Add file` $\rightarrow$ `Upload files`.
6. Upload your dashboard and associated files. Press `Commit changes`.
7. Press `<> Code` (top left) to go back to the top level of the repo
8. Press `Contribute` $\rightarrow$ `Open pull request` to request merging your files into the main repo
9. Press `Create pull request` when you're ready.
10. If you need to make further changes, no worries - the pull request will stay up to date with these **until approved or closed**.

Give it a go if you can! 

If there's any issues, we'll leave a comment for you to fix up the merge and we'll approve it when ready.

### Upload dashboard to Teams

If you're having issues with the GitHub approach, we can upload it for you. Just put your folder with the dashboard into our [Teams folder](https://uq.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/1qktlisq/Shared%20Documents/R%20User%20Group/R%20Training%20Intensive%20Projects?csf=1&web=1&e=wwVB7w).
