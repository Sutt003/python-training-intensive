title: The Project
---

The best way to learn is by doing. That's why, over the these three days, **you are tasked with analysing, visualising and reporting on a set of data!**

Roughly 50% of our intensive is dedicated to working on the project. Working in groups of 2-4, you'll need to use the techniques we learn to draw some observations about your chosen dataset. 

The end goal will be a quick fire (low stakes) one-minute presentation with a dashboard to complement.

## The datasets

We have eight datasets for you to choose from:

| Dataset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [World populations](data_sources/population.csv) | A summary of world populations and corresponding statistics | 
| [Soccer players](data_sources/Players2024.csv) | A summary of about 250 2024 soccer players |
| [Coffee survey](data_sources/coffee_survey.csv) | A survey of coffee preferences | 
| [Melbourne housing data](data_sources/melb_data.csv) | A collection of houses for sale in Melbourne | 
| [Goodreads books](data_sources/books.csv) | Data for 50,000 goodreads books |
| [Queensland hospitals](data_sources/hospital_data.csv) | Emergency department statistics |
| [Queensland fuel prices](data_sources/qld_fuel.csv) | Fuel prices by the pump in Queensland | 
| [Aeroplane bird strikes](data_sources/birds_strikes.csv) | Aeroplane bird strike incidents fron the 90s| 

## Project outline

There are a few key requirements for the project, but otherwise it's up to you!

- Analyse a dataset and create some visualisations 
- Put together a final dashboard-style report. Anything from a powerpoint slide to an interactive dashboard will do!
- Deliver a quick fire one-minute presentation with your group

We'll have 5 sessions during the intensive days to work on the project, just shy of six hours. The goal of these sessions is twofold

1. To work on the project, analysing data and creating visualisations
2. To dive deeper into the content, perfect for questions and conversations

While you'll be working in groups, everyone should practise analysing and visualising the data. We recommend distributing roles amongst the group, maybe looking at different variables or different presentation formats.

You're welcome to use the project time however you'd like. Below is a rough guide if you're unsure:

| Session | Recommendation | 
| --- | --- |
| Tuesday afternoon | Pick a dataset and play with the data |
| Wednesday morning | More exploratory analysis, consider dividing roles amongst group |
| Wednesday afternoon | Start collecting initial visualisations and preparing format (e.g. dashboard) |
| Thursday morning | Continue analysing and creating visualisations |
| Thursday afternoon | Polish up results |

The presentations will be during Thursday's final session at 2:50pm.

Good luck!
