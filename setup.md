title: Intro and Setting Up
---

## Overview
Welcome to our three-day Python training intensive! By Thursday afternoon, you'll have learnt the R skills to manipulate, visualise and present data. We'll spend roughly half the time learning content, and half the time working on a project in groups.

As we set up, there's a few things to do, if you haven't already

1. [Install the software](#software)
2. Introduce yourself to your table
3. [Join our Teams channel](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=z3fjtrOdy0aRovrZYFuxXEzmI13TctBBiWhneXZv-1lUQ1MwQ0JUM0ZBS0hXV1NJSU04TEZEUFg2Si4u)
4. Register your attendance

## Software

We are going to use [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) for writing and running Python. This is a friendly interactive development environment (IDE) aimed at researchers. **However, you are more than welcome to use your own!**

Please set up Python and your IDE in advance. 

If you don't have Python or an IDE, we recommend [installing Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), which comes with Python.

## Creating a Project

If you're using Spyder, we recommend you create a **project**. Projects are just fancy folders, and they make it easier to access files (i.e. data) and export images (i.e. visualisations) all in the one place.

1. Open Spyder
2. In the *Projects* menu, click *New Project...*
3. Choose *New Directory*, give your project a name and find an appropriate place on your computer for it.
4. Press *Create*

Done! We'll work in this project for the duration of the intensives.
