title: Intro and Setting Up
---

Welcome to the Python Training Intensive! Over the next three days we'll be covering the essentials that you'll need to begin analysing your data with Python, alongside completing an independent project to practise your skills.

## Software

We are going to use [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) for writing and running Python. This is a friendly interactive development environment (IDE) aimed at researchers. **However, you are more than welcome to use your own!**

Please set up Python and your IDE in advance. 

If you don't have Python or an IDE, we recommend [installing Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), which comes with Python.

## Creating a Project

If you're using Spyder, we recommend you create a **project**. Projects are just fancy folders, and they make it easier to access files (i.e. data) and export images (i.e. visualisations) all in the one place.

1. Open Spyder
2. In the *Projects* menu, click *New Project...*
3. Choose *New Directory*, give your project a name and find an appropriate place on your computer for it.
4. Press *Create*

Done! We'll work in this project for the duration of the intensives.
