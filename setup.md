Welcome to the Python Training Intensive!

## Setting Up

We are going to use [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) for writing and running Python. This is a friendly interactive development environment (IDE) aimed at researchers. **However, you are more than welcome to use your own!**

Please set up Python and your IDE in advance. 

If you don't have Python or an IDE, we recommend [installing Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), which comes with Python.
